# AngluarGlu

Angular-Glu is an lightweight library based on [AngularJS][angular] & [Google Material Design specifications][material].

## Why is it lighter than other material libs ?

Because we do not use any JavaScript that we do not need and because this lib will never use JS for animations.

## So, why AngularJs ?

Because [AngularJS][angular] is the most powerful MV* JS framework, and because I use it on most my work.

## How can I install AngularGlu ?

- Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/clementTal/angular-glu.git.
- Install with Bower: `bower install angular-glu`.
